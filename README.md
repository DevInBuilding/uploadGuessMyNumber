<h1>Guess The Number Game</h1>
<h2>Simple game developed with JavaScript</h2>

<p align="justify">
    The game presented here in this repo is an improvement of one that was learned in a JavaScript Course I am doing during these days, where I modified some implemented functions, added some nice color when you lose the game, refactored game's code - making it clearer and understandable,- instead of many lines of code written with the same command.

    This game works as follows: first of all, you need to add some number between 1 and 20 in the input box, click on <em>Verify!</em> button, and check the result in the message area displayed on the interface. After that, you see if you got it or not. When you get it, then a congratulation message will appear in the page and the background color will change from "darkgray" to "green". When you win, you can click on the <em>Try Again</em> button and try it again as many times as you like, seeing if you've reached the displayed high score.
